On 21 September 2019, we had our 19th SIMSSA workshop, this time here at McGill in collaboration with [CIRMMT](https://www.cirmmt.org). This weekend coincided with a workshop for Julie Cumming's new SSHRC Grant, Mapping the Musical Landscape of the 16th Century (MML16), as well as Jennifer Bain's new partnership grant, Digital Analysis of Chant Transmission (DACT). Scholars involved in all three projects were here for a few days to make plans and exchange ideas, and the SIMSSA Workshop had around 45 attendees.
